<br>
The dataset has some mistakes. <br>
The UNSW_NB15_training-set.csv is actually the testing set, so to use the program change the name to testing.csv . <br>
The UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv is actually the training set, so to use the program change the name to training.csv . <br>
<br>
Also, if you uncomment the feature reading command, change the name of the file to UNSW_NB15_features.csv since by mistake it is called USNW-NB15 blah blah.
